// Assign a new value to the variable num. The code will not work the way it is. Find the mistake and fix it. Execute the corrected code.
let num = 1;
num = 2;
console.log(num);

// Here, we declare the variable num. But, it has no value yet. Assign a value to it and run the code.
let num;
num = 2;

// Here, we have two variables numOne and numTwo. numOne already has a value. Assign numTwo the value of numOne and run the code.
let numOne = 5;
let numTwo = numOne;

// Below, we attempt to assign the value of a variable named numOne to the variable numTwo. But, that variable has not been declared yet. Declare a variable named numOne and run the code.

// In this simple exercise we declare a variable called num and assign it a value of 5. Then we try to log the value of the variable using the console.log() method.
// But, the console.log() method contains a small mistake. If you try to run the code, you will see an error message.
// Fix the mistake and run the code again.
const num = 5;
console.log(num);

// This exercise is very similar to the previous one. We declare a variable called num, assign it a value of 5, and try to log it. But again, we introduced a small mistake.
// Fix the code and run it.
const num = 5;
console.log(num);

// In this exercise we practice how to declare a new variable and how to assign it a number. The console.log() statement below attempts to log a variable named num.
// Declare a variable with this name and assign it a number of your choice. Run the code to see if the number is being logged.
const num = 5;

// The code below first declares a variable named num with a string value hello. Then, a new value bye is assigned. Finally, the variable is logged.
// But, the code will not work like that. Find the mistake and fix it. Execute the corrected code.
let num = 1;
num = 2;
console.log(num);
console.log('The value of num is: ' + num);
